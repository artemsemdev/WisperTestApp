# Contributing to VoxFlow

Thanks for contributing. This repository contains a local-first .NET 9 transcription system with CLI, Desktop, MCP, and shared Core projects. Contributions should preserve the project's privacy-first and configuration-driven design.

## Before You Start

- Read [README.md](README.md) for project scope and current status.
- Read [docs/developer/setup.md](docs/developer/setup.md) for prerequisites, build commands, and runtime setup.
- Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the product docs before making broad design changes.
- For behavior, feature, or workflow changes that are not obviously small, open an issue first so scope and direction are aligned before implementation.

## Ground Rules

- Keep changes focused. One pull request should solve one problem or one tightly related slice of work.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits with clear messages.
- Keep the product local-only. Do not introduce cloud-hosted transcription dependencies or remote data flows without explicit maintainer approval.
- Preserve configuration-driven behavior where that pattern already exists.
- Do not include secrets, private recordings, or sensitive transcripts in code, tests, screenshots, or issue attachments.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a branch from the latest default branch.
2. Make the smallest reasonable change that solves the problem completely.
3. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
4. Update documentation when commands, configuration, architecture, or UX expectations change.
5. Run the relevant validation commands before opening a pull request.

## Local Validation

From the repository root:

```bash
dotnet restore VoxFlow.sln
dotnet build VoxFlow.sln --no-restore
dotnet test VoxFlow.sln --no-build
```

If you changed the macOS Desktop app or UI automation path, also run the desktop UI suite on macOS when possible:

```bash
./scripts/run-desktop-ui-tests.sh
```

If you cannot run a relevant validation step, say so clearly in the pull request and explain why.

## Code and Documentation Expectations

- Follow the existing naming, structure, and formatting conventions in the surrounding code.
- Prefer explicit, testable behavior over implicit or hidden side effects.
- Keep logging and diagnostics useful, but avoid leaking sensitive local file contents or user data.
- When changing product behavior, update the relevant docs in `README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `docs/product/`, or `docs/architecture/`.
- Add comments only where the code would otherwise be hard to understand.

## Pull Request Expectations

Each pull request should include:

- a concise description of the problem and the change
- links to related issues or rationale if the change stands alone
- a short testing summary listing what you actually ran
- screenshots or recordings for user-facing Desktop UI changes when they help reviewers
- notes about configuration, migration, or breaking changes when applicable

PRs that mix refactors, feature work, and unrelated cleanup are harder to review and may be sent back for narrowing.

## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

- Use the GitHub issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and documentation improvements.
- For security vulnerabilities, do not file a public issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
