# Risks, Assumptions, and Open Questions

> Honest assessment of what the architecture depends on, where it is exposed, and what remains unresolved.

## Assumptions

These are conditions the architecture depends on that are not enforced by the system itself.

### A1. Whisper.net native runtime remains stable

The transcription pipeline depends on Whisper.net (v1.9.0) and its bundled libwhisper native binaries. The architecture assumes:

- The native runtime works reliably on both Apple Silicon and Intel macOS
- `WhisperFactory` and `WhisperProcessor` are safe to reuse within a single process
- `processor.ChangeLanguage()` is safe to call between inference passes

**Mitigation:** The Intel Mac Catalyst CLI bridge (ADR-021) was introduced specifically because the in-process Whisper runtime was unreliable under Mac Catalyst on Intel. This demonstrates a willingness to work around native runtime issues at the host level.

### A2. ffmpeg is available and correctly installed

All audio conversion depends on ffmpeg as an external process. The architecture assumes:

- ffmpeg is installed and accessible on `PATH` or at a configured path
- ffmpeg supports the configured audio filter chain and output format
- ffmpeg handles the input audio format correctly

**Mitigation:** Startup validation checks ffmpeg availability before processing begins (ADR-008). If ffmpeg is missing or broken, the system fails fast with a clear message.

### A3. Local file system is the sufficient persistence layer

VoxFlow uses the local file system for all state: configuration, models, intermediate audio, and transcript output. There is no database. The architecture assumes:

- File paths are writable and have sufficient disk space
- No concurrent access to the same output files
- File system permissions are adequate for the current user

**Mitigation:** Startup validation probes key directories for writability. Batch temp files use GUID-suffixed names to avoid collisions.

### A4. Single-user, single-instance execution

The system assumes one user runs one instance at a time. There is no:

- File locking on output or temp files
- Concurrent access protection for the Whisper model file
- Instance detection or singleton enforcement

**Mitigation:** This is appropriate for a local developer tool. If concurrent execution is needed, it would require file locking and potentially model instance pooling.

### A5. macOS is the only Desktop platform

The Desktop host targets `net9.0-maccatalyst` exclusively. The architecture assumes:

- MAUI Blazor Hybrid works reliably on Mac Catalyst
- AppleScript accessibility automation is available for UI testing
- Platform-specific features (native drop, file picker, Finder integration) are macOS-only

**Mitigation:** Core business logic is platform-agnostic. Adding Linux or Windows Desktop hosts would require new MAUI targets and platform-specific UI code, but no Core changes.

## Risks

### R1. Native runtime version coupling

**Risk:** Whisper.net upgrades may change native library behavior, introduce regressions, or drop support for older macOS versions.

**Impact:** Transcription may fail or produce different results after a Whisper.net update.

**Current state:** Pinned to Whisper.net 1.9.0. No automated compatibility testing across Whisper.net versions.

**Mitigation options:** Pin the version (current approach); add regression tests with known audio/transcript pairs; run smoke tests after dependency updates.

### R2. Intel Mac Catalyst CLI bridge fragility

**Risk:** The Intel CLI bridge depends on a working `dotnet` host and a buildable or pre-built `VoxFlow.Cli` at the expected path. If the CLI binary is missing, outdated, or the `dotnet` runtime is not available, Desktop transcription fails on Intel.

**Impact:** Intel Mac users cannot transcribe files in the Desktop app.

**Current state:** The `BuildDesktopCliBridge` MSBuild target rebuilds CLI during Desktop builds. Desktop startup does not validate CLI availability independently.

**Mitigation options:** Add a Desktop startup check for CLI bridge health; bundle the CLI binary inside the Desktop `.app`.

### R3. AppleScript UI automation is fragile

**Risk:** macOS UI automation via AppleScript and Accessibility depends on specific UI element names, window titles, and system permissions. macOS updates may break element identifiers or change Accessibility behavior.

**Impact:** Desktop UI tests fail after macOS updates, giving false negatives.

**Current state:** Tests use element identifiers where possible. Accessibility permissions must be granted manually.

**Mitigation options:** Accept this as inherent to macOS UI automation; keep the UI test suite small and focused on critical paths; add diagnostic screenshots on failure (already implemented).

### R4. No code signing or notarization

**Risk:** Unsigned macOS app bundles trigger Gatekeeper warnings and may be quarantined by macOS. Users must manually override security warnings to run the app.

**Impact:** Poor first-run experience for users who receive the packaged `.app` or `.pkg`.

**Current state:** `scripts/build-macos.sh` produces local artifacts without signing or notarization.

**Mitigation options:** Add signing and notarization to the build pipeline when external distribution is needed. For development, `dotnet run` avoids the issue entirely.

### R5. MCP protocol evolution

**Risk:** The Model Context Protocol is evolving. Future MCP specification changes may deprecate current tool/prompt patterns or require new capabilities (resources, sampling, etc.).

**Impact:** MCP client compatibility issues; need to update the MCP server implementation.

**Current state:** Uses `ModelContextProtocol` NuGet v1.1.0. Exposes 7 tools and 4 prompts. No first-class MCP resources. `McpOptions` has unenforced configuration toggles for future capabilities.

**Mitigation options:** The MCP server is a thin host. Protocol updates affect only the MCP project, not Core or other hosts.

### R6. Full audio buffer in memory

**Risk:** Very large audio files (multi-hour recordings, high-quality formats) may exhaust available memory when `WavAudioLoader` reads the entire file into a `float[]` array.

**Impact:** `OutOfMemoryException` for unusually large files.

**Current state:** Acceptable for typical use (1-hour recordings use ~400 MB total). No streaming alternative exists.

**Mitigation options:** Add a file-size preflight check to startup validation; implement streaming WAV loading if large-file support becomes a requirement.

## Open Questions

### Q1. Should batch processing be exposed in the Desktop UI?

Batch processing is fully implemented in `VoxFlow.Core` and available via CLI and MCP, but the Desktop app only supports single-file transcription. The question is whether Desktop users need batch capability, and if so, what the UX should be (queue, folder picker, progress per file).

**Current decision:** Deferred. Desktop scope is explicitly single-file for now.

### Q2. Should the MCP server support HTTP/SSE transport?

The MCP server is stdio-only (ADR-017). HTTP transport would enable remote MCP clients but introduces authentication, CORS, port management, and network surface area — all of which conflict with the local-only security model.

**Current decision:** Deferred until a concrete use case requires remote MCP access.

### Q3. Should structured output formats (JSON, SRT) be supported?

Transcript output is plain text only (`{start}->{end}: {text}` per line, ADR-002). Structured formats would enable richer downstream processing but add output format management.

**Current decision:** Deferred. Plain text serves current consumers.

### Q4. What is the model download strategy for Desktop distribution?

The Desktop app currently expects the Whisper model to be present on disk or downloaded on first use. For a distributed `.app`, the question is whether the model should be bundled (large app size), downloaded on first launch (requires network), or managed separately.

**Current decision:** Not resolved. The current approach (download on first use) works for development but may not be acceptable for end-user distribution.

### Q5. What is the long-term strategy for Intel Mac support?

Intel Mac support via the CLI bridge is a workaround for Whisper.net instability under Mac Catalyst x64. As Intel Macs age out of the user base, the question is when to drop Intel-specific code paths.

**Current decision:** Maintained for now. The CLI bridge is isolated in the Desktop host and does not complicate Core.
